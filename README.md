# MEVN-App

MEVN-App is the boilerplate code that I use as a strting point to develop a complex web app. It's a full stack code base, using Vue(With Veutify) at the Front End and Node JS backend with all-most all the basic API needed in any web app. It uses Sequelize ORM for database connectivity with Relational Databases.

# Features!

  - Vue with Vuetify (Material Design)
  - Node JS API for Authentication, File Uploads and Email Service.
  - Separate front-end and back-end code base (MVVC architecture).
  - Also the client is PWA comapaitible. :)

> Please look in client and server subdirectories for installation instructions.
